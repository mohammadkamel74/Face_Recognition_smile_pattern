# Face_Recognition_Smile_Pattern

Face recognition is the problem of identifying and verifying people in a photograph by their face. Since every Smile is [Unique](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.01873), in this project an attemp is made to propose Smile Pattern as a new biometric trait for face recognitionuse task. In this project we extract dlib facial landmarks and track their movements during video frames using optical flow. Finally, by using curve fitting we extract the coefficients of each landmark.
